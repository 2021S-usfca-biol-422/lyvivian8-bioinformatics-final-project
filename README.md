Final Project Log: 

2021-04-28: Found sequenced positive samples from the Haute-de-France from the NCBI database of Sars sequenced data. Edited Readme.md file to reflect SRA Bioproject objective.

2021-04-29: SSH server crashed. 

2021-05-01: Cloned the git repository and reinstated packages for makefile. Uploaded SraRunTable.txt file into our forked git repository.

2021-05-02: Process the SraRunTable.txt through the makefile bash pipeline. 

2021-05-03: After processing SraRunTable.txt through the makefile bash pipeline and modifying the necessary code for the trimmomatic script, I opened the processed files through cyberduck to make sure they were properly sourced. 

2021-05-08: Ran the sample R-script in the Report.rmd file in order to make sure that the report is able to be knit correctly with the figures and tables. 

2021-05-09: Began writing code chunks to generate figures that analyzed the processed vcfR files from the makefile pipeline.

2021-05-10: Finished writing code for all the figures and began writing code for the tables. 

2021-05-11: Switched orders of figures to be coherent with the analysis of our code. Formatted presentation and wrote conclusions based off of our analysis derived from the figures.

2021-05-12-13: Wrote background information, results and discussion section of our final report.
